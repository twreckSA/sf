# sf
Front-end small project to refine a landing page of a web app, where the user selects application to navigate.

The inital page was:
![sf1](https://github.com/StavrouA/sf/assets/60097126/20e2ed4f-840b-4fce-a7fd-7431191058ba)

The end result is (the tabs shine and rotate on hover):
![sf2](https://github.com/StavrouA/sf/assets/60097126/a4f521a3-e8a8-46fe-bbd5-a36eae95ebc5)

Light-grey tabs are the applications that the user has access to. Dark-grey tabs are inaccessible.
